# PHPolySleep
This is the new version of the website, written mainly in PHP to provide functionality.
There is a stable version running on Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk right [here](http://phpolysleeep.bdm5qmkja7.eu-central-1.elasticbeanstalk.com).

There are still major changes to be made before it can safely replace the [old version](https://github.com/PolyphasicSleep/polyphasicsleep.github.io), which is why this new version is only available on the default domain provided by  AWS.
